        <h3>My inspiration</h3>
        <article>
          <img src="python_logo2.jpg" alt="" width="3%">
          <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-simple-gui-calculator-using-tkinter/">Basic python calculator using tkinter</a>
          <p>This is the basic code that ignited my imagination and made me want to start this project. It is very simple and easy to understand, and was very inviting to buildup on.</p>

        <h3>My motivation</h3>
        <p>One week in April 2020 when I was confined to my apartment with the <i>hubby and children</i> My oldest daughter found an old calculator.
            As expected from a youngster she kept pressing the keys and asking me to read out the the numbers on the screen. This made me thing - my daughter and son know their numbers up to 30,
            maybe 40, but not much more. If the calculator could talk - they could eventually learn on their own higher and higher number names, as well as some math as a bonus.</p>
